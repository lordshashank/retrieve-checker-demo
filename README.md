## Overview

Deal Retrieve Checker is a decentralized solution for verifying and ensuring the reliability of data retrieval in Filecoin's storage ecosystem. This project enhances the Filecoin network by implementing a dispute resolution system that validates storage providers' abilities to reliably serve stored content, creating a more accountable and transparent storage marketplace.


## üîç Problem Statement

As we enter a new era defined by AI breakthroughs and the growth of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), the importance of not just storing‚Äîbut efficiently retrieving data‚Äîhas never been more critical.

AI models increasingly rely on real-time, large-scale data access. Meanwhile, DePIN systems‚Äîfrom edge computing to IoT‚Äîdemand reliable, verifiable data availability across trustless networks. This shift calls for infrastructure where retrieval is as decentralized and resilient as storage.

That‚Äôs where Filecoin steps in.

Filecoin has redefined decentralized storage by creating a robust, trustless marketplace for storing verifiable data. But now, with advancements like retrieval markets and retrieval incentives, it's evolving into a truly end-to-end decentralized storage and retrieval layer for the internet.

Our dApp builds on this foundation‚Äîdesigned not just to store data securely, but to ensure it can be retrieved fast, privately, and reliably‚Äîpowering the needs of AI workloads, real-time DePIN apps, and beyond.

In a world where storage is decentralized but access is everything, Filecoin‚Äôs retrieval layer is the missing puzzle piece‚Äîand we‚Äôre building right on top of it.

In decentralized storage networks like Filecoin, while storage proofs ensure data is initially stored correctly, there's often no reliable mechanism to verify ongoing retrieval capabilities. Storage providers might store data correctly but fail to serve it efficiently (or at all) when requested. Deal Retrieve Checker addresses this critical gap in the storage ecosystem.

## üéØ Project Aims

- **Enhance Retrieval Reliability**: Establish a robust system to verify that storage providers can efficiently serve content when requested
- **Strengthen SLA Guarantees**: Implement Service Level Agreement enforcement for Filecoin storage deals
- **Protect Clients**: Provide recourse for clients when data cannot be retrieved from storage providers
- **Economic Incentives**: Create a staking mechanism that incentivizes reliable service from storage providers
- **Transparent Dispute Resolution**: Enable fair and transparent resolution of retrieval disputes

## üí° Solution

Deal Retrieve Checker introduces a comprehensive solution with two key smart contracts:

1. **RetrieveChecker**: Manages the dispute raising and resolution process from the checker network. The flow looks like following:

![Retrieve Checker Flow](frontend/public/retreve_checker.png)

Checker network has a smart contract implementation as [here](contracts/contracts/RetrieveChecker.sol). It provides `raiseDispute()` functionality that can be used by anyone to raise a dispute corresponding to a particular `cid` and `storageProvider` in Filecoin. It then distributes the retrieval task to checker nodes running the RETRIEVE CHECKER SUBNET implemented at https://github.com/lordshashank/retrieve-checker.

These nodes submit the result of retrieval tasks to the checker network which then submits the result on-chain using the `resolveDispute()` function.

2. **DealRetrieve Checker**: Retrieve Checker is a general implementation which can be used by anyone to develop a market around retrieval SLA.

Deal Retrieve Checker is one such example. It allows anyone to challenge deal retrieval in Filecoin and get rewarded if an SP is not providing retrieval. The flow looks like following:

![Deal Retrieve Checker](frontend/public/deal_retrieve_checker.png)

The technical flow works as follows:
1. Storage providers register by staking tokens (minimum stake required)
2. Users identify deals with potential retrieval issues
3. Users raise disputes by specifying deal ID and provider
4. The `challengeDealRetrieval` function retrieves the on-chain payload-cid and raises the dispute with the retrieve-checker contract with this cid and SP
5. Checker network verifies the retrieval capability
6. Disputes are resolved as either:
   - RESOLVED (retrieval worked, challenge failed)
   - FAILED (retrieval failed, challenge succeeded)
   - REJECTED (invalid challenge)
7. For resolved disputes where retrieval failed:
   - Provider is penalized (stake is reduced)
   - Dispute raiser receives a reward
   - Client receives a portion of the penalty

The system creates accountability through economic incentives and transparent dispute resolution, ensuring that storage providers maintain their retrieval capabilities throughout the lifetime of a deal.

## üîó How It Enhances Filecoin & Checker Network

### For Filecoin
- **Solving the Retrieval Verification Gap**: Currently, Filecoin lacks a robust mechanism to verify that stored data can actually be retrieved. While storage proofs ensure data is stored correctly, there's no on-chain solution to verify or enforce retrieval capabilities.
- **Enabling FVM-Based Retrieval dApps**: This project creates the foundational infrastructure for developers to build retrieval-focused decentralized applications on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), opening up an entirely new category of applications.
- **Customizable Storage Markets**: By providing a retrieval verification system, developers can now create customized storage markets with enforceable Service Level Agreements that include both storage and retrieval guarantees.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Creates accountability for the retrieval phase of storage deals, addressing a critical missing component in the Filecoin ecosystem.
- **Market Confidence**: Builds trust by ensuring providers maintain retrieval capabilities throughout the entire lifecycle of deals.
- **Quality Metrics**: Provides transparent metrics on provider reliability that were previously unavailable.
- **Economic Alignment**: Aligns economic incentives with reliable service provision, creating a more balanced marketplace.

### For Checker Network
- **Beyond Spark Checker's Limitations**: While the existing Spark Checker provides a score to Storage Providers by checking deal file headers, it doesn't actually guarantee retrieval capabilities to clients. The Retrieve Checker subnet takes this several steps further.
- **True Retrieval Guarantees**: Implements actual retrieval verification rather than just checking file headers, ensuring data can truly be accessed when needed.
- **Enabling Retrieval SLAs**: Provides the critical infrastructure for developers to create enforceable retrieval Service Level Agreements - a significant advancement toward a complete on-chain storage marketplace.
- **Extended Functionality**: Adds comprehensive retrieval verification to the checker network's capabilities.
- **New Verification Type**: Implements a new type of on-chain verification challenge with real-world utility.
- **Economic Opportunity**: Creates new earning opportunities for checker nodes that participate in retrieval verification.
- **Network Utility**: Substantially increases the utility and value of the checker network by solving a critical problem in decentralized storage.

## üöÄ Future Plans

This project represents a minimal market implementation around the Retrieve Checker contract. Our vision extends much further:

- **Robust Market Development**: Build a more sophisticated and well-defined market for retrieval guarantees with advanced pricing mechanisms and reputation systems

- **Checker Network Integration**: We're awaiting Checker Network to integrate our flow and deploy the Retrieve Checker subnet we've developed, which will enable on-chain dispute raising and resolution

- **Subnet Expansion**: Increase the number of nodes running the Retrieve Checker subnet to enhance the robustness and decentralization of the verification network

- **Enhanced Analytics**: Implement advanced data visualization and analytics for network performance

- **Cross-chain Support**: Expand functionality to support other blockchain networks beyond Filecoin

The success of this system depends on community participation - particularly running nodes in the verification subnet to ensure truly decentralized assessments of retrieval capabilities.

## üîí Security Considerations

- Smart contracts have been developed with security best practices
- Economic parameters are carefully balanced to prevent attacks
- Dispute resolution includes safeguards against malicious challenges
- Staking requirements prevent Sybil attacks
